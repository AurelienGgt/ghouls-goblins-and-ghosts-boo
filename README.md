<h1 align="center">🧛‍♂️ Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts - BOO! 👻</h1>

<h2 align="center">📌 Description</h2>

<p align="center">
Can you classify the monsters haunting Kaggle?  
This project is a classification challenge where we analyze various features of creatures to determine if they are <br> 
<strong>Ghosts</strong>, <strong>Goblins</strong>, or <strong>Ghouls</strong>.
The dataset provides physical attributes such as bone length, rotting flesh percentage, hair length, and soul percentage.
</p>


<h2 align="center">📂 Dataset Files</h2>

<h3>🔹 Training and Test Data</h3>

- **train.csv** – Contains labeled data for training the model.
- **test.csv** – Contains unlabeled data for predictions.
- **sample_submission.csv** – Example of a correctly formatted submission file.

<h3>🔹 Data Fields</h3>

Each creature has the following attributes:

- **id** – Unique identifier.
- **bone_length** – Average length of bones (normalized between 0 and 1).
- **rotting_flesh** – Percentage of rotting flesh.
- **hair_length** – Average hair length (normalized between 0 and 1).
- **has_soul** – Percentage of soul presence.
- **color** – Dominant color of the creature (white, black, clear, blue, green, blood).
- **type** – Target variable indicating the creature’s category: Ghost, Goblin, or Ghoul.

<h2 align="center">🎯 Objective</h2>

<p align="center">
Develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify a given creature into one of the three categories (Ghost, Goblin, or Ghoul) based on the provided attributes.
</p>

<h2 align="center">🚀 Getting Started</h2>

<h3>📊 Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>

- Analyze the distribution of features.
- Visualize relationships between attributes and creature types.

<h3>🏗 Model Training</h3>

- Experiment with classification algorithms (e.g., Neural Networks).
- Optimize hyperparameters for best performance.

<h3>📤 Submission</h3>

- Generate predictions on `test.csv`.
- Submit results formatted like `sample_submission.csv`.

<h2 align="center">🤖 Possible Approaches</h2>

- **Feature Engineering**: Create and select relevant features.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Impute or remove incomplete entries.
- **Model Selection & Hyperparameter Tuning**: Test multiple models and fine-tune for optimal accuracy.

<h2 align="center">📈 Evaluation</h2>

<p align="center">
Models will be evaluated based on classification accuracy.
