**🧛‍♂️ Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts - BOO! 👻**

-------------------
**📌 Description**
-------------------


Can you classify the monsters haunting Kaggle? This project is a classification challenge where we analyze various features of creatures to determine if they are Ghosts, Goblins, or Ghouls. The dataset provides physical attributes such as bone length, rotting flesh percentage, hair length, and soul percentage.


-------------------
**📂 Dataset Files**
-------------------


**🔹 Training and Test Data**

train.csv – Contains labeled data for training the model.

test.csv – Contains unlabeled data for predictions.

sample_submission.csv – Example of a correctly formatted submission file.


-------------------
**🔹 Data Fields**
-------------------


Each creature has the following attributes:


id – Unique identifier.

bone_length – Average length of bones (normalized between 0 and 1).

rotting_flesh – Percentage of rotting flesh.

hair_length – Average hair length (normalized between 0 and 1).

has_soul – Percentage of soul presence.

color – Dominant color of the creature (white, black, clear, blue, green, blood).

type – The target variable, indicating the creature’s category: Ghost, Goblin, or Ghoul.


-------------------
**🎯 Objective**
-------------------


Develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify a given creature into one of the three categories (Ghost, Goblin, or Ghoul) based on the provided attributes.
